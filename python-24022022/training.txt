Python Basic Concepts
------------------------

-> In python there are two methods to runing code
1) Interactive mode 
2) Script mode

->Interactive mode
Interactive mode, also known as the REPL provides us with a quick way of running blocks or a single line of Python code. 
The code executes via the Python shell, which comes with Python installation.
REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.

*The >>> indicates that the Python shell is ready to execute and send your commands to the Python interpreter. 
The result is immediately displayed on the Python shell as soon as the Python interpreter interprets the command.

REPL
R-read
E-evaluate
P-print
L-loop


Range function
---------------
Python range() function returns the sequence of the given number between the given range.

range() is a built-in function of Python.
In simple terms, range() allows the user to generate a series of numbers within a given range.
Depending on how many arguments the user is passing to the function, 
user can decide where that series of numbers will begin and end as well as how big the difference will be between one number and the next.range() takes mainly three arguments.

start: integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned
stop: integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned. The range of integers end at stop â€“ 1.
step: integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence


There are three ways you can call range() :
-------------------------------------------
range(stop) takes one argument.
range(start, stop) takes two arguments.
range(start, stop, step) takes three arguments.
