->Control Statements in python:

1) Sequence statements
2) Conditional statements
3) Loop statements

-> Loops and Control Statements (continue, break and pass) in Python

1) While Loop

Syntax :
while expression:
    statement(s)


2) For in Loop

Syntax:

for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)



3) Nested Loops

Syntax:
for iterator_var in sequence:
    for iterator_var in sequence:
        statements(s)
        statements(s)


-> Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= 

------------------
-> Python Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops

->The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

->The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.
