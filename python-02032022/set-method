difference() -        Returns a set that is the difference between two sets
difference_update()	- Updates the existing caller set with the difference between two sets
discard()-	          Removes the element from the set
frozenset()	-         Return an immutable frozenset object
intersection()-       Returns a set that has the intersection of all sets
intersection_update()-Updates the existing caller set with the intersection of sets
isdisjoint() -      	Checks whether the sets are disjoint or not
issubset()-           Returns True if all elements of a set A are present in another set B
issuperset() -	      Returns True if all elements of a set A occupies set B
