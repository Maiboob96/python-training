Python Concepts

-> In python there are two methods to runing code
1) Interactive mode 
2) Script mode

->Interactive mode
Interactive mode, also known as the REPL provides us with a quick way of running blocks or a single line of Python code. 
The code executes via the Python shell, which comes with Python installation.
REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.

*The >>> indicates that the Python shell is ready to execute and send your commands to the Python interpreter. 
The result is immediately displayed on the Python shell as soon as the Python interpreter interprets the command.
